# SimpleToDo
This is a Android to-do app, from which I started to learn Android development by following the instructions from https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Basic-Todo-App-Tutorial. 

More features are intended to enhance this app, such as:

- Showing several options on long click
- (Possibly) slide list item to delete
- Adding a finish option
- Setting due date and reminder for tasks
- Adding a comment field
- Setting up categories
- Share tasks with others
