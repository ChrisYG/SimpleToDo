# SimpleToDo
This is a Android to-do app, from which I started to learn Android development by following the instructions from https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Basic-Todo-App-Tutorial. 

More features are intended to enhance this app, such as:

- Showing several options on long click?
- Highlight a task
- (Possibly) slide list item to delete
- Adding a finish option (high priority)
- Setting due date and reminder for tasks (high priority)
- Adding a comment field
- Setting up categories/tags
- Share tasks with others (via what? low priority)
- Adding a habit-tracking system
- Recording a task
- (For fun) achievement system
- Refining UI
